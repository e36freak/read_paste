read_paste [OPTIONS] URL

Downloads URL, getting the raw format for the supported pastebins. If URL is
not one of the supported pastebins, it is treated as already being in a raw
format. Normally writes to stdout, unless -e or --editor is used.

 Options:
  -h, --help            display this help and exit
  -e, --editor          opens file with vim after downloading
  -H, --highlight SYN   when using the -e or --editor option, tells vim
                        what the filetype is for syntax highlighting. while this
                        program will automatically try to get this information
                        from the site, doing so will not always be possible.
                        this option will override any information acquired from
                        the site.
  -a, --add SYN=LANG    add SYN to the configuration file. LANG must be a *.vim
                        file in your vim's VIMRUNTIME or in ~/.vim/syntax. the
                        .vim on the file may be omitted. This option can be
                        used multiple times, to add multiple syntaxes. Any
                        existing SYN in the file will be overwritten with the
                        new value for LANG.
  -l, --list            list available values for SYN and exit
  -r, --remove-cr       force removal of carriage returns (ASCII 13) from
                        downloaded files
  -f, --file FILE       if -e is not used, write to FILE instead of stdout. if
                        -e is used, use FILE instead of a temp file

Valid syntaxes for -H are stored in:
  "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/read_paste/syntaxes.conf"

Currently supported pastebins:
  gist.github.com
  pastebin.com (will automatically remove CRs)
  paste.pocoo.org
  pastie.org
  sprunge.us


syntaxes.conf:
  This file contains the valid syntaxes for -H. Each line contains two fields,
  key:value.  "key" is the term that read_paste looks for, when determining
  what language to use syntax highlighting for. "value" is the appropriate
  *.vim file in your VIMRUNTIME/syntax directory. The '.vim' at the end is
  omitted in the config.
